</ul>

<h2>Signing Up</h2>

<p>To log into CodeTennis, just sign in with your OpenId.</p>  

<p>Not sure what OpenId is?  You probably already have one, even if you don't know it. 
	There are some instructions on the CodeTennis sign-up page, but if you don't 
	even know how to spell OpenID then go on over to 
	<%= link_to "myopenid.com", "http://myopenid.com" %> and sign yourself up.</p>

<h2>Twitter Notifications</h2>

<p>CodeTennis sends notifications via twitter.  If you don't have a Twitter account, 
	sign up over at <%= link_to 'twitter.com', "http://twitter.com" %>.</p> 

<p>You'll also want to follow the twitter user <%= link_to "code_tennis", "http://twitter.com/code_tennis"  %>.</p>


<h2>Application Setup</h2>

<p>CodeTennis works with github, so the application you'll be playing with needs 
	to be hosted there. Instructions are available at 
	<%= link_to "github", "http://github.com/guides" %> if you need them.</p>

<p>Once you've got your app set up on github, you'll need to tell github to notify CodeTennis of new commits.  Here's how:
<ul>
<li>Go to the your app's home page on github, and click the edit button;</li>
<li>Click next to "Post-Receive URL" to edit;</li>
<li>Enter http://tampa-rb.r08.rails.rumble.com, and save.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once all the players have signed up at CodeTennis, it's time to start a new match:
<ul>
<li>Click on "Matches" and then "Set up a new match";</li>
<li>Enter a name and description for the match;</li>
<li>Enter the github username and project, NOT the entire github project URL.</li>
</ul>
<%= image_tag("match_setup_github_details.jpg", :alt => "GitHub Match Setup") %>
</p>
<p>If you're one of the players, make sure "Include yourself as a player" is checked.</p>

<p>To add another player, click on Users and then on the player you want. On that player's page, select the new match from the list and click 'Add'.</p>
<%= image_tag("add_player_to_match.jpg", :alt => "Adding a player to a match.") %>

<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<h3>Matches</h3>
<p>A match is any shared programming project you keep track of with CodeTennis. Matches include two players, and a github project.</p>

<h3>Volleys</h3>
<p>A volley is one CodeTennis turn.  The first player starts a coding task, and does any number of commits to complete the task.  When the task is complete, the player signals the end of his volley and the next player starts.
<p> To mark a volley as closed, include [volley] in your git commit message, and push the changes to github.</p>
<p>When CodeTennis sees that a volley has ended, it will notify the next player that his turn is up.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that CodeTennis volleys can be distinct tasks, like a Lighthouse ticket, 
	or just any chunk of code that makes sense for one person to do.</p>
<p>When the project is complete, the match admin player can mark the match as closed.  Then, time for another match!</p>
<h3>Watching the Game</h3>
<p>You can follow the progress of a match by <%= link_to 'selecting the match', matches_path %> and checking out the commit history and timeline.  Also, the 
<%= link_to 'code tennis twitter user', "http://twitter.com/code_tennis" %>
will have a running list of volley notifications.</p>
